put small amount of AV on your acane, not too intensive and not too low, no need to rinse it

do your hair with kirela

rest for more than 2 hours

prepare CAV put 1tbsp of AV and half cast oil or 1tbsp, then mix them good

use the mixin on the bald chin spots and leave for more than an hour then rinse it off, repeat that 2- times a week 

use the mixin on your scalp and gently do massaging, leave at least 30 minutes before rinsing, repeat that 2- times a week 

dont wash your face after it so you should be متوضأ

so in short we wake up, we pray, we wash and pat, we put AV and Kerala, we rest,[ we prepare, we put mixin, we rinse it], we wait for going to bed,
	we wash and pat, we put little AV
