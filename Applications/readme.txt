we will talking about some applications and when to use them:
	expensify and in-expense: use them when u want to track the in-out money, receipts for you or for group, expensify is better features
	QuickBooks and Xero: these applications are similar to `expensify and in-expense`, they do same thing, but more, these applications are full suite
		not like `expensify and in-expense` focusing only on expenses, they covering many things like invocing, payout, transactions, mileage,...etc.
		they have ability to run business specially small business, while `expensify and in-expense` tends more for individuals or groups
	bloimerberg and CNBC yahoo finance: actually i didnt really understand too much, there things and terms first time to see and im totally dont understand
		also i dont know what is happening, but there is a part where it gives some news about different fields like finnanical and economics
		, by the way i have tried bloomerberg and yahoo finance, and for my POV yahoo finance providing clearer information displaying
	Trading Economics and Economic Times: i have tried trading economics, and i can say im understanding a bit, the applications is easy to understand
		where u are and what is this is, but i still dont understand what are these numbers mean and what does commidents, indexes and currency mean
		also it provide news for economics and market
	JSTOR and EconLit: Online libraries where you can find academic research papers and articles, i cant use any of them because they dont have 
		mobile application so instead we will use other apps we find
		ResearchGate Academia.edu: those apps for same purposes but for mobile, it looks like ResearchGate is great it has beutiful UI
		unlike Academia where it is more comprehensive but with bad UI/UX
	exness: it looks a good application for trading, however there are things i dont understand, but the UI/UX in this application is stunning
		also i dont know if it accepts EGP, but it looks only accepts USD, or similar coins
