1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,410
what's up everybody's Charles today I'm

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:02,280
going to show you how to lift your

3
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:03,810
vehicle all four wheels off the ground

4
00:00:03,810 --> 00:00:06,270
on four jack stands now we're gonna be

5
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,099
using my mark seven and a half of golf R

6
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:09,030
for this job

7
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:10,410
so if you drive that kind of car you hit

8
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,480
the jackpot otherwise what we're gonna

9
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,280
talk about today does apply to basically

10
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,650
any vehicle typically I like to only

11
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,510
lift either the front or the rear up at

12
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,070
one time but there's a handful of jobs

13
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,600
that require all four wheels off the

14
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,330
ground or for the car to be level things

15
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:26,039
like manual transmission service Haldex

16
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:27,689
service we need the car level or if

17
00:00:27,689 --> 00:00:28,830
we're doing things like rotating the

18
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:30,359
tires or bleeding brakes it's nice to

19
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:31,890
have all four wheels off the ground

20
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:33,450
because safety is our number one concern

21
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:35,190
here we want to make sure we do some

22
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,960
things before actually lifting the car

23
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,550
one we want to make sure we're on a

24
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:40,829
level hard surface if you're working on

25
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:42,870
hot asphalt you may want to take a piece

26
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,430
of metal or a piece of wood underneath

27
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:46,559
your jack and your jack stands so the

28
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,809
car doesn't sink into the asphalt and if

29
00:00:48,809 --> 00:00:50,039
we can avoid it we definitely don't want

30
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,890
to do this on grass sand or gravel next

31
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,300
we want to make sure that the steering

32
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,829
wheel is straight we want to make sure

33
00:00:55,829 --> 00:00:57,510
the car is in park or if it's a manual

34
00:00:57,510 --> 00:00:59,969
transmission in first gear we want to go

35
00:00:59,969 --> 00:01:01,949
ahead and set the parking brake and

36
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:03,690
we're going to be chalking the front and

37
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:05,909
the rear wheels once we've secured the

38
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:07,380
vehicle go ahead and do a quick check of

39
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,360
your jack stands and make sure that

40
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,920
they're in good condition and I always

41
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,869
like to test the floor jack and have a

42
00:01:12,869 --> 00:01:14,939
little fun while doing it also every car

43
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:16,200
is different so you want to refer to

44
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,820
your vehicle owners manual to see the

45
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,860
proper lifting points on your car some

46
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:21,210
vehicles have the lifting point in the

47
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,040
very front or the very rear of the

48
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,810
vehicle which makes lifting that end of

49
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:27,420
the car much much easier because this VW

50
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,189
has so much plastic we don't want to

51
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,079
lift it up by the front core support or

52
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:33,509
the rear bumper that can cause damage to

53
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:35,460
the vehicle so I'm gonna show you how I

54
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,000
do it

55
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,880
again keeping safety in mind also after

56
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,079
you lift the vehicle if you're gonna be

57
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,030
taking the wheels off it's a good idea

58
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,710
to go ahead and loosen those lug bolts

59
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:45,899
and lug nuts a little bit before lifting

60
00:01:45,899 --> 00:01:47,670
the car once we have our vehicle in the

61
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,320
proper spot where we're going to lift it

62
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,509
next we need to find the pinch welds

63
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:53,490
under our car now if your vehicle has a

64
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,110
full frame this makes it really easy

65
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,420
just use the frame typically a unibody

66
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,340
car like this is going to have four

67
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,930
points on the vehicle that are actually

68
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,939
meant for lifting these are reinforced

69
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:05,880
areas on the pinch weld right behind the

70
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,890
front tires and right in front of the

71
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:08,639
rear tires

72
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,709
these spots typically hang down a little

73
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:12,390
bit lower than the rest of the pinch

74
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,770
weld or can even be

75
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,840
indicated by a notch or something on the

76
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,460
body of the car now if your car has a

77
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,990
side skirt or something low like this

78
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,690
you may want to take a hockey puck or a

79
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:23,910
block of wood to extend the distance

80
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,400
between the side skirt and the jack we

81
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,840
don't want to crush our side skirt when

82
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,400
we lift up our car once we have

83
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,110
everything in place and we found the

84
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,090
pinch weld we want to set the jack as

85
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,070
perpendicular to the body line of the

86
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,810
car as we can now you really want to

87
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,040
take your time here to make sure the

88
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,870
jack pad or the hockey puck whatever

89
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,880
you're using is is centered on the pinch

90
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,100
weld as you can get it I like to slowly

91
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,710
put the jack up to the vehicle then go

92
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:48,060
ahead and give it a pump and make sure

93
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,100
that it's secured we also want to look

94
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,330
and make sure we're not doing any damage

95
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,190
to the pinch weld here if you feel like

96
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:55,110
it's bending lower the jack down and

97
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,120
reset it now from here we can go ahead

98
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,770
and lift our car up we noticed something

99
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,900
really awesome about a car like this it

100
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,360
lifts the front and the back up so we're

101
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,130
gonna start with the jack stand at the

102
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:07,110
back of the vehicle now there's two main

103
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:08,490
kinds of jack stands we have the ones

104
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,470
with the flat pad and ones with the

105
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:12,750
grooved pad both work really well so use

106
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,730
what you have one thing I don't like to

107
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,010
do is take the jack stand and extend it

108
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,810
all the way out it makes me a little

109
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,459
uncomfortable when it's at its top

110
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:22,320
setting so we're gonna actually drop it

111
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:25,320
down one lower than that I also like to

112
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,120
take a little piece of shop rag to

113
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,250
protect the pinch weld and set it on top

114
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,900
we're gonna leave this one here we're

115
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,610
gonna set the front now when it comes to

116
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:34,500
setting the front I like to put the jack

117
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,320
stand on the subframe if possible this

118
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,270
can get a little tricky if you're doing

119
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,160
something like working on the subframe

120
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,900
once we get the car off the ground I'll

121
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,090
show you how to move the jack stands so

122
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,610
that it's not up on the subframe in case

123
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,170
you're doing work there so we're gonna

124
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,720
take our jack stand I like to go just

125
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:56,070
behind the control arm there's a really

126
00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:00,510
nice spot right here so we're going just

127
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,000
behind this front bolt for the lower

128
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,040
control arm there are multiple places

129
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,900
you could put the jack stand underneath

130
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,600
on the subframe you just want to make

131
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,910
sure that it's as close to the outside

132
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,440
of the vehicle as possible because we

133
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,600
are gonna put one on the other side once

134
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,988
we have our jack stands properly secured

135
00:04:18,988 --> 00:04:22,860
we're going to very slowly lower the car

136
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,530
down keep in mind that the car may

137
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:27,330
actually shift a little bit while you're

138
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:30,420
lowering it down so go as slow as you

139
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,740
possibly can

140
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,060
once the weight of the vehicle is on the

141
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:34,800
jack stands you can go ahead and lower

142
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,750
the jack all the way and then just

143
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,889
double check and make sure your jack

144
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:39,480
stands are properly centered now you may

145
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,370
feel the car's not up high enough we can

146
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,080
raise it up a little bit at a time once

147
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:51,300
we get the whole car off the ground now

148
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:52,560
we're gonna do the same thing on the

149
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,240
other side all right we'll start with

150
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,800
the back again get our jack stand in

151
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,120
place something we want to pay attention

152
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,370
to on this side though we want to make

153
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,560
sure that we have the jack stand set at

154
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,870
the same height that we had the other

155
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,090
side the same height we had the other

156
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,400
side left three holes exposed so we're

157
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,620
gonna set it there just like that we'll

158
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:16,200
get our needlessly OCD shop rag set on

159
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,700
there and we'll go ahead and center it

160
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,190
right in the pinch weld now we'll do the

161
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:22,680
front next want to do the same thing in

162
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,440
the front as we did in the back two

163
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,510
holes exposed just like the other side

164
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,729
and we want to set it right in the same

165
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:32,250
place and again very slowly and

166
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,800
carefully lower the jack down once you

167
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,780
have the entire vehicle up on the jack

168
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:38,610
stands give the car a little shake and

169
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,680
make sure it's properly secured couple

170
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,390
other things I like to do I like to

171
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,820
leave the jack underneath the car with

172
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,550
just a touch of pressure holding the car

173
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:50,250
up this is just one backup in case

174
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,500
something crazy happens also if you're

175
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,660
taking the wheels off go ahead and slide

176
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,340
the wheel and tire assembly underneath

177
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:59,130
the car so that if it does slip it'll

178
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:00,810
land on the wheel and tire assembly not

179
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:03,330
on your face now if you need to do work

180
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:05,070
on the subframe we can't support the car

181
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:07,440
with the subframe so what we're gonna do

182
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,000
once the cars off the ground and

183
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,740
properly secured we're gonna take our

184
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:12,539
floor jack we're gonna slide it up

185
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:16,020
underneath the car to the subframe now I

186
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:19,320
like to lift it right in front of where

187
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,390
the center dog-bone mount is or the

188
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:23,880
pendulum mount not on the bushing but

189
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,070
right in front of it if you go up in

190
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,150
that bushing hole you're just gonna

191
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,550
probably knock the bushing out lift the

192
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:32,280
car up once the car is lifted off the

193
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,659
jack stands we can go ahead and move

194
00:06:33,659 --> 00:06:35,729
those two jack stands to the front pinch

195
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,919
welds and now one thing I do want to do

196
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,390
is I want to raise this up

197
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,910
so it has three holes exposed to match

198
00:06:41,910 --> 00:06:44,340
how high I have the back ones that way

199
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:46,320
when we set the car down it'll be nice

200
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:48,330
and level alright so there we have it

201
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:50,670
our cars properly lifted secured ready

202
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,740
to go for whatever job we're going to do

203
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:54,780
for me I think it's time to put some

204
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,910
wheel spacers and new wheel bolts on

205
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:58,380
give this car a little bit better

206
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,210
fitment for the wheel and tire guys

207
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:01,590
