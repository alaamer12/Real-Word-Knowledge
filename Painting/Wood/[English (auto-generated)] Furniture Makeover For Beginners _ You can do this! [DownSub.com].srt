with you guys today and my biggest piece

00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,719
of advice to

anyone that is brand new to furniture

00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,320
painting

31
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:05,840
is to start small and just keep it

32
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,960
simple i like to start off every

33
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,600
furniture flip with a really good

34
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,640
cleaning

35
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,280
today i'm just using some dawn dish soap

36
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,080
but really

37
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,320
any type of cleaner that you have or

38
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,280
that you like

39
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,320
that has a good degreasing factor in it

40
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,520
is going to do you the best service here

41
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,200
we want to remove any obvious cobwebs

42
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,479
or dust that is on the piece but we also

43
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,520
want to clean away

44
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,640
any grease from furniture polishes over

45
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,840
the years

46
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,119
or fingerprints around knobs that stuff

47
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,799
is really going to repel

48
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,759
a new painted finish so it's gotta go

49
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,000
once your piece is nice and clean

50
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,840
it is important to go back with some

51
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:52,399
clean clear water and rinse away any

52
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,159
soap residue

53
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,079
once i was finished cleaning i let my

54
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,399
table dry really well for a few hours

55
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:00,000
and then i moved it out onto the back

56
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,200
deck because

57
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,600
it's a really nice day and my next step

58
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,040
is sanding which is going to make a

59
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,479
little bit of a mess

60
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,919
i'm starting off with a foam sanding pad

61
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:12,160
this is an old one that doesn't have any

62
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,840
real grit left on it

63
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,720
so i just wrapped a piece of 80 grit

64
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,280
coarse

65
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,239
sandpaper around it and i'm going to use

66
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:21,840
this to remove

67
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,040
any of this old flaking finish

68
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,680
off of my table each piece is going to

69
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,879
be a little bit different

70
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,599
if the piece that you're working on has

71
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:33,280
a finish on it that is still

72
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,720
intact and not loose or flaking up

73
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,959
you don't need to do this really coarse

74
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:40,239
80 grit sand

75
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,720
you can get away just with a light scuff

76
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,360
sand

77
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,840
in my case this needs to be removed

78
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,239
because if i go ahead and apply my new

79
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:49,200
finish

80
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,400
on top of this failing finish my new

81
00:02:52,400 --> 00:03:05,599
finish is going to fail as well

82
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,560
the base of this table is in much better

83
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,360
condition

84
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,239
finish wise it is not flaking or peeling

85
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:13,280
off at all

86
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,319
so i switched out my sandpaper to a

87
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,239
much softer 220 grit and i'm just

88
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,360
lightly scuffing up the surface i don't

89
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:25,519
need to remove the previous finish

90
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,920
i just want to scratch it up a little

91
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,280
bit and give my paint

92
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:33,840
something good to hold onto

93
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,840
[Music]

94
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,879
i did also go back over that top surface

95
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,159
with the softer 220 grit sandpaper just

96
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,760
to smooth out any harsh

97
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,640
scratch marks that may be left behind by

98
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,690
that 80 grit that i started with

99
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,879
[Music]

100
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:57,200
once i was all done with my sanding i

101
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,799
came back with just a clean

102
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,519
damp rag and wiped away any dust that

103
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,239
was left behind

104
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,799
the next step in my painting process is

105
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:07,360
always

106
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,159
primer i'm going to be using my all-time

107
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:10,799
favorite

108
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:13,120
zinzer bin shellac base primer this

109
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,239
primer serves

110
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:17,120
a couple of different important purposes

111
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,519
one

112
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,238
the shellac in it is going to block in

113
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:21,040
any wood

114
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,160
tannins or the naturally occurring oils

115
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:24,880
in

116
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,280
the wood and the wood stain on this

117
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,320
piece

118
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,360
those oils tend to bleed up

119
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,280
through water-based paint finishes or

120
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,880
top coats and leave

121
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,040
really ugly stain marks in your new

122
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,000
finish

123
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,160
the bin shellac based primer will

124
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,080
prevent that from happening

125
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,199
it's also going to give me a nice smooth

126
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,240
unified surface between the bare wood

127
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,759
top that i now have and the existing

128
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,240
finish

129
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,160
on the base that's going to make sure

130
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,680
that my paint is

131
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,240
sitting the same and absorbing the same

132
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:58,720
amount

133
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,000
into those two different substrates if i

134
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,240
didn't have this primer on the top and

135
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,120
the bottom

136
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,199
the paint would absorb differently into

137
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,400
that bare wood top

138
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,320
as opposed to sitting on top of the

139
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,600
previous finish

140
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,000
and you'd be able to see the difference

141
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:14,960
this primer

142
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,560
is messy and stinky so i like to line my

143
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,880
paint tray with a little bit of tin foil

144
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,039
you also need to make sure that you mix

145
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,440
this product very well the shellac tends

146
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,120
to separate out of it if it's sitting in

147
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,880
the can for a while

148
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,160
and i wear gloves and use it outside or

149
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,639
in a

150
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,680
very well ventilated area it does have a

151
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,880
strong odor

152
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,600
my favorite way to apply this is with a

153
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,240
four inch

154
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,520
microfiber roller you can by all means

155
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,960
use a foam roller or a cheap disposable

156
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,680
brush

157
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,639
i wouldn't use a good high quality brush

158
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,000
with this stuff because it's

159
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,880
really hard to clean up so i like to use

160
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,160
something that i can

161
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,039
use once and toss when i'm done using my

162
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:00,880
roller i'm going to apply

163
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,639
a coat evenly over the entire table

164
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,919
this is a very thin runny product so you

165
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,990
do want to watch for

166
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:18,610
[Music]

167
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,840
drips

168
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,440
i usually apply two coats of this primer

169
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:27,840
to

170
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,479
my pieces that's usually enough to block

171
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:31,280
in any

172
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,479
wood tannin bleed through situations

173
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,319
and make sure that everything is nice

174
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,440
and smooth it dries really fast you only

175
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,240
need maybe

176
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,520
15 or 20 minutes between coats just make

177
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,199
sure that you wrap up your

178
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,919
roller and any primer that is left in

179
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,120
your paint tray

180
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,280
in a plastic grocery bag so it doesn't

181
00:06:51,280 --> 00:07:03,599
dry out

182
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,919
my primer is dry so i moved my table

183
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,840
back inside and i'm just going to give

184
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,120
it a really

185
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,720
light smoothing sand with some

186
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,039
very fine sandpaper this is a 400 grit

187
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,280
just to smooth out any of that bumpy

188
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:30,560
roller texture that can happen sometimes

189
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,479
now that we've got all of that prep work

190
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:33,599
out of the way

191
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,560
it is time to add some color to this

192
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,440
piece

193
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,160
i chose to use melange paint on this

194
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,520
project which is

195
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,000
an artisan style mineral paint and i'm

196
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,360
going to be using the color

197
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,280
sonora rose melange is a brand new

198
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,759
small veteran-owned business out of

199
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:53,680
sugarland texas

200
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,400
they have created this beautiful

201
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,440
luxurious

202
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,560
buttery paint specifically made for

203
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,160
furniture applications

204
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,440
like this their hand poured paint

205
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,759
comes in four different size

206
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:08,800
eco-friendly

207
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,759
glass jars and their palette is

208
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:12,639
incredible

209
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,360
they have so many colors and are adding

210
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,080
new ones

211
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,039
all the time i'm applying my paint today

212
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,080
with a

213
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:23,599
zebra fan brush this is a really

214
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:26,800
great inexpensive all-purpose

215
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,840
brush for furniture i like to apply

216
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,120
my paint in light thin coats

217
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,279
as opposed to trying to get full

218
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,799
coverage in the first

219
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:40,320
go this is really going to help prevent

220
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,599
brush strokes or building up any texture

221
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,160
if you're going for a really smooth

222
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,680
sleek finish

223
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,040
i am personally a very messy brusher

224
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,680
my technique is always just to get the

225
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,240
paint

226
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:56,959
on there and then i come back with a

227
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:57,519
very

228
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:00,240
light hand and smooth out all of the

229
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,720
brush strokes in the same direction

230
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:05,760
this paint has incredible coverage on

231
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,399
the first

232
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,640
coat but depending on the paint that

233
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:09,760
you're using

234
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,880
you may notice that it's very splotchy

235
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,839
or patchy looking and that is completely

236
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,880
normal remember light thin

237
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,040
coats you want to build your coverage

238
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,240
gradually

239
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,640
so that you're avoiding creating any

240
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,640
texture or brush strokes

241
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,360
apache finish will fill itself in with

242
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:37,839
the second or third coat of paint

243
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:54,240
[Music]

244
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,399
once i was finished with my first coat i

245
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,720
closed up my jar of paint and tucked my

246
00:09:58,720 --> 00:09:59,200
brush

247
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,160
into a little plastic baggie to keep it

248
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:02,640
fresh

249
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,350
while i'm waiting for this to dry

250
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:12,079
[Music]

251
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:13,839
my first coat is dry and you can

252
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:15,200
definitely see

253
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,560
it is streaky and patchy totally normal

254
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,519
like i said

255
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,680
don't freak out this is all gonna fill

256
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:23,200
in with your second coat

257
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,640
and if it doesn't fill in with your

258
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,880
second coat it's no big deal to go back

259
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,240
for a third

260
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:31,519
like i said melange is a brand new small

261
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:34,160
family-owned business and morgan the

262
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,000
creator of this paint line

263
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,560
has been working really hard to find an

264
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,200
efficient

265
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,440
and economical way to start shipping up

266
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,480
to canada

267
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,560
which all of us canadians know can be

268
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,880
ridiculously expensive

269
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,040
and she just may have a canadian

270
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,399
retailer in line

271
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,519
any day now wink wink nudge nudge

272
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,079
as soon as there is a canadian retailer

273
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:58,480
set up and ready i will pin that link in

274
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:01,120
the comments section of this video

285
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,760
once you're finished painting if you

286
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,279
notice that you have

287
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,360
a slight amount of brush strokes or

288
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:33,440
texture that you're not happy with

289
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,760
you can always go back over your paint

290
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,120
again with a super

291
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,680
soft fine grit sandpaper like a 320

292
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:45,200
or 400 grit just to smooth things out

293
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,920
then we are ready to seal everything up

294
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:48,560
and give it

295
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,160
a few good coats of protection

296
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:53,440
[Music]

297
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,279
i'm going to be using my all-time

298
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:57,040
favorite verithane

299
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,839
diamond wood finish in a satin sheen

300
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:01,279
this is a very

301
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:05,440
user friendly water-based poly top coat

302
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,079
i like to pour a little bit out into a

303
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:09,519
separate container

304
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,720
and mix in a tiny bit of my paint to

305
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,560
tint my top coat

306
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:17,600
most furniture paints on the markets are

307
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,560
matte and porous that really helps them

308
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,440
stick to

309
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:24,320
furniture pieces but it also means that

310
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,200
they do need

311
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,480
some additional top coat protection

312
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,720
that's going to seal in that matte

313
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,079
porous paint

314
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,279
make it wipeable and protect it from

315
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:38,480
finger marks and just general wear and

316
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:39,279
tear

317
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,440
when you're brushing on a liquid top

318
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,480
coat like this

319
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,399
you're going to want to work in small

320
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:46,000
sections again

321
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,560
i like to get it on really quickly and

322
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,519
then come back

323
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,000
and smooth it over with a very light

324
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,959
hand

325
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,560
all in one direction after that don't

326
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:59,279
touch it if you notice that you've got a

327
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,320
bare patch

328
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,440
or you're not liking the look of it

329
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:06,480
just leave it alone let it dry don't

330
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:07,120
fuss with

331
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,519
it if there's something wrong we'll fix

332
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:20,690
it later

333
00:13:20,690 --> 00:13:29,659
[Music]

334
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,880
this specific top coat needs one to two

335
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,600
hours

336
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,560
to dry between coats i left this for

337
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,480
about an hour and a half and then i came

338
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,760
back again

339
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,720
with my super fine grit sandpaper just

340
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,240
to smooth it out

341
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,959
this is the time if you have a drip or

342
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,000
an area that you're

343
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,800
not really in love with you can use this

344
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,320
super fine sandpaper

345
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,199
to buff that out a little bit again you

346
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:57,680
want to do that when the top coat is dry

347
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,680
not when it's wet or you'll just make a

348
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,160
mess just like with the paint

349
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,639
the second coat is really going to make

350
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:05,760
the difference here

351
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,480
and we're going to use this to fill in

352
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:10,160
any patchy areas

353
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,240
areas that we missed areas that we

354
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,440
weren't really in love with

355
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,079
on the first pass and give everything a

356
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:16,560
really

357
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:19,760
beautiful unified satin sheen

358
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,959
one more quick nugget of advice here

359
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,760
is something that seems so simple but it

360
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,320
is really easy to overlook

361
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:31,040
there are so many different paints and

362
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,880
paint products out on the market right

363
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,560
now and they all vary

364
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:37,760
slightly it's really important to take

365
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:38,639
the time

366
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,880
to research the products that you're

367
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:41,920
using

368
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,040
and just read the label they're going to

369
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,680
tell you

370
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,600
everything that you need to know to

371
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,480
apply to your specific project

372
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,920
from application to drying times

373
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,279
curing times recommended temperatures

374
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:00,399
all of that stuff is right on the label

375
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,720
once my second coat of top coat was dry

376
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,639
i was really happy with the finish that

377
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:05,519
i had

378
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,399
so i tucked the drawer back in attached

379
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,600
a new knob

380
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,360
and this is what our finished piece

381
