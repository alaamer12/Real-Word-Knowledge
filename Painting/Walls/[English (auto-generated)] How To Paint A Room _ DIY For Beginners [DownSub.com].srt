right so no blue tape let's just get

26
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,440

to know in this video so that you can

29
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,239
master the art of painting because if

30
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,480
you know how to paint you can do things

31
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,320
to your house that are the greatest

32
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,920
return of investment is to paint your

33
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,800
house inside outside kitchen cabinets it

34
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,239
doesn't matter what you want to paint

35
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,440
when you're done this video you're going

36
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,800
to have the skills and confidence to do

37
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,519
it remember on the scale of difficulty

38
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,320
painting is like number one it's the

39
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:10,159
most easiest thing there is to learn on

40
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,200
the market

41
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,640
but it's the greatest skill to have

42
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,159
because if you can't paint you can't

43
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,040
finish

44
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,960
if you can't finish your project

45
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,640
really shouldn't be starting so let's

46
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,000
learn this skill

47
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,360
let's dive through and watch the whole

48
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,640
video i'm going to show you everything

49
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,560
you need to learn let's just jump right

50
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,320
into the rig okay so here are the

51
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,920
must-haves all right

52
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,240
we've got to have a paint tray

53
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,680
you really want to have a liner

54
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,920
especially as a homeowner

55
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,600
because what the liner does

56
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,680
it allows you to finish your job and

57
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,040
just throw this in the garbage so you

58
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,040
don't have to wash everything

59
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,360
this little yellow arm is

60
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,360
it's it's nice to have but it's not a

61
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,399
definite you're going to want to have a

62
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,479
nice cage like this this is the wooster

63
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,240
cage and yes we're going to have links

64
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,520
for all the tools in the video

65
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,439
description just so you know okay this

66
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,320
is the wooster sherlock handle and this

67
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,119
slides in it has a pin and does positive

68
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,399
lock

69
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:01,600
never again are you going to have to

70
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,079
paint while the handles are spinning off

71
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,680
this is amazing

72
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:08,800
once you have that set up you've got the

73
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,280
ability now to extend it

74
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,360
and retract it all right

75
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,160
this

76
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,440
rod reduces your work by about 60 to 70

77
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,040
percent it makes the job effortless

78
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,599
you also need a sleeve

79
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,920
okay we use microfiber

80
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,480
this is a 18 mil

81
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,640
there we go that's my rolling rig you're

82
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,080
also going to want to have a three inch

83
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,360
angle brush

84
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,800
this is my three inch angle brush

85
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,400
doesn't have to cost a fortune you can

86
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,640
get a good one for about 20 bucks

87
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,000
and then i've got my 501 tool all right

88
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,160
this is a scraper and used as a

89
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,080
screwdriver also

90
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,080
when you're all done today

91
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,080
it will clean all the extra paint out of

92
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,400
the roller sleeve okay

93
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,519
by the time you're done painting you're

94
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:54,720
gonna have almost a quart of paint

95
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,959
sitting in this thing so this

96
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:58,239
make sure that you don't have to spend

97
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,159
so much time washing your gear it'll

98
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,599
also put the paint back in the can so

99
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,440
you've got it for touch-ups later

100
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,480
all right you're going to want to have

101
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,560
an alpha knife because

102
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,239
have i ever done a job in my entire life

103
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,840
i didn't pull out a knife at least once

104
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,959
of course you're going to want a ladder

105
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:12,159
if you're vertically challenged like i

106
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,280
am

107
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,680
and you're going to want to pull

108
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,519
some sort of a sanding pad

109
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,400
okay

110
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,840
remember a good paint job is all about

111
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,200
the preparation and if you're not

112
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,560
sanding in between coats you're going to

113
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,400
get a poor performance okay

114
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,159
now in today's video i'm not going to

115
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:26,959
share

116
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,879
all about patching and touch-ups and all

117
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,280
the repairs we've got videos for that

118
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,319
we'll put a link in the video

119
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:34,000
description where you can check the link

120
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,159
right here on the cart okay now let's

121
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,319
just jump right into it because the

122
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,920
thing that separates a good paint job

123
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,440
from a bad paint job

124
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,239
is the material it's the paint now i've

125
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,840
been using different paints for a lot of

126
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:48,239
years been using c2 for the last 12 on

127
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,680
and off in different jobs absolutely

128
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,159
love this paint high wash ability okay

129
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:55,840
high wear great for high traffic areas

130
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,000
and they have proprietary technology

131
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,480
they use a poly whey as their hardener

132
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,319
okay so the strength in this paint isn't

133
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,159
coming from an oil-based product so

134
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,760
there's no resins which means there's no

135
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,360
shortage no supply issues which is why

136
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,519
we're promoting this right now okay

137
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,200
the other thing it is it has very low

138
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,120
vocs which means when you paint your

139
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,480
house doesn't smell like you painted for

140
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,439
a week

141
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,399
absolutely amazing okay no headaches

142
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,680
cheers to that

143
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,279
when it comes time to paint all you've

144
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,840
really got to do is clean the space put

145
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,759
down a tarp and then you gotta remove

146
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,280
all your cover plates because this is

147
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,960
where the preparation comes in

148
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,280
that's where the knife comes in handy

149
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,840
back out all your screws

150
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,160
take all the cover plates off do not

151
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:38,000
paint around cover plates

152
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,080
that is not cool

153
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,919
okay all right so the purpose of this

154
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:46,080
video is not to show you how to paint

155
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,240
from new drywall it's to show you how to

156
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,520
repaint

157
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,120
most people want to do a paint job

158
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,880
because well let's face it the color's

159
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,000
ugly

160
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,759
or they're living in a brand new house

161
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:57,680
and the builder use really cheap paint

162
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,600
and they can't wash the walls step one

163
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,400
is grab some trim paint and fix all of

164
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,400
these mistakes right here

165
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,080
where they were painting the wall and

166
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,680
they got the wall paint all over the

167
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,880
trim

168
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,560
not cool because if you come along and

169
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,240
you do a nice job you're going to have

170
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,919
three colors sitting right there it's

171
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,320
going to scream so

172
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,880
before you start

173
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,199
take some trim paint

174
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,080
and

175
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,680
make sure that that edge is painted now

176
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,280
i don't care if you get it all over the

177
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,400
wall because you're going to come back

178
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,919
and cut a new line but just make sure

179
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:32,240
that any old paint is covered up there

180
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,560
we go that's much better same holds true

181
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,479
for the ceilings

182
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:37,680
you might find that you have to paint

183
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,280
the whole ceiling paint your ceiling if

184
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,400
you have to start with a clean palette

185
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,520
if you need to learn how to paint a

186
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,720
ceiling it's a little different

187
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,400
technique you can click the video link

188
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,280
right here or check the video

189
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,199
description below because in when you're

190
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,720
painting ceilings we follow different

191
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,479
rules and walls okay

192
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:53,919
it's just about the

193
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:55,440
which direction you want to paint all

194
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,440
that information's in that video let's

195
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,600
just get on with how to paint your room

196
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
next step once you've got your ceiling

197
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,960
lines cleaned up and your trim lines

198
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,000
cleaned up is you're going to want to

199
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,960
sand

200
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,840
just use a sanding sponge if you have to

201
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,360
now you don't have to spend good money

202
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,440
on a rig i'll guarantee you when the

203
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,039
builders painted this

204
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:16,720
they did not do any sanding

205
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,080
and the walls

206
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,560
feel like sandpaper

207
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,400
now this wall has to be sanded properly

208
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,400
now the coolest thing is we're ready to

209
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,880
paint right now no tape don't waste any

210
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,680
time

211
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,199
it's funny because there are two things

212
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,880
that the painting world never teaches

213
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,160
homeowners

214
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,759
never teaches them to sand which is

215
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,039
amazing because

216
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,479
the difference in a wall that's been

217
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,319
sanded versus a wall that hasn't been

218
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,560
sanded is to the touch you can walk into

219
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,560
any house in the world and just go like

220
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,479
this and if it's not smooth like a

221
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,080
baby's bum

222
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,759
it wasn't sanded and you know because

223
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,000
it's just gritty it feels like a dirty

224
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,840
wall

225
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,199
i think one of the reasons they don't

226
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:06,479
tell you to sand is because they want

227
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:07,840
you to not be happy with the finished

228
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,199
product so you buy another gallon of

229
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,080
paint

230
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,120
try doing it all over again i don't know

231
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,520
the other thing they never tell you

232
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,560
is to use a paint stick

233
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,919
come on be honest every time you see a

234
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,479
commercial or a movie any advertisement

235
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,639
from a paint company

236
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,440
they always got somebody standing there

237
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,680
painting the wall like this

238
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,160
oh and everybody thinks that's normal

239
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,080
this is the most abnormal painting

240
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,240
technique in the whole world nobody who

241
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,919
ever made a dollar ninety-five over a

242
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,840
lifetime paints that way there's a

243
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,160
reason for it

244
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:44,960
hey

245
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,960
this is a lot easier you can extend the

246
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,080
pull and keep your hands below your

247
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,360
heart when you're working which means

248
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,520
half the work

249
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,120
it's not all the stress in your forearms

250
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,560
because you're holding the darn thing

251
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,800
right now you can use two hands

252
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,440
half the work again and on top of that

253
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,360
you can get much even distribution of

254
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,479
the paint

255
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,319
right it's going to blow your mind when

256
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,240
you see how easy this is now just for

257
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,400
the record the color here is bubba

258
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,680

259
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,840

270
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,479
price consider it

271
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,839
they don't use oil based resins

272
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,240
to make their paint hard and washable so

273
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,240
they don't have supply issues

274
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,200
now

275
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,200
i hope this turns out

276
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,399
it looks like i'm going to be painting

277
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:43,919
cream on cream

278
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,839
no way it's too bad hmm

279
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,440
baba ganoush

280
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,519
yep that's different

281
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,120
all right guys

282
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,720
so the paint brush is brand new right

283
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,200
now okay which i don't have anything

284
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,560
loaded into it

285
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,560
so what i'm doing is i've got about two

286
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,920
and a half inches of paint left in this

287
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,519
can all right

288
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,120
and i'm just pushing the paint into the

289
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,000
brush

290
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,600
and until i get it loaded up enough i'm

291
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,080
not going to try to cut the ceiling line

292
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,959
now the wall here is a flat paint oddly

293
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,320
enough

294
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,160
so what we want to do is we want to

295
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,880
drive our paintbrush nice and slow about

296
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,680
a quarter inch from the ceiling

297
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,600
okay whenever you're painting a new

298
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,480
washable paint over a

299
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,560
something that's flat

300
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,760
you want to

301
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,080
get the first coat of paint on

302
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,560
before you try to be too delicate and

303
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,240
get too close to the surface okay

304
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,920
because the paint doesn't slide it

305
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:38,880
doesn't move well on on a flat paint so

306
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,720
at the second coat that's when we'll

307
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,560
push that right into the corner you'll

308
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,399
see when we get there this works really

309
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,920
well

310
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,600
while you're on a ladder do the other

311
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
side of the hole while you're at it

312
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,320

cheers well done let's get back to the

332
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,959
video here we go now now we got the

333
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:34,640
paint brush working i'm going to show

334
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,839
you how to cut the outside of a wall

335
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,160
generally speaking outside corners are

336
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,000
sharp edges you want to use the heel of

337
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,640
the brush which is this part right here

338
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:47,040
set your brush on it and it'll fan out

339
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,279
again draw about a quarter inch away and

340
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:51,279
you get a ridge paint now you come back

341
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,560
with the paint

342
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,839
and you can

343
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,600
just draw right up against the edge of

344
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,160
that that corner

345
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,240
you don't ever want to use a roller here

346
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,160
when you stand on the other side looking

347
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,839
this way you don't want to see two

348
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:06,880
colors

349
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,880
all right this is the secret

350
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,200
so if you just use the heel

351
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,880
draw a line and then you can push that

352
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,399
paint right up to the edge

353
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,880
you'll get a perfect edge that's how the

354
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,800
pro is cut in the corners

355
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,079
now if you're going to be painting your

356
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,240
walls and you're changing the color

357
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,440
you're not going to want to change all

358
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,360
your baseboards and paint them again and

359
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,200
all your other trim again it's just like

360
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,040
the ceiling only upside down the secret

361
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,480
here

362
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,399
you want your head to be able to see

363
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:33,360
underneath

364
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,720
so you got to get close to the ground

365
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,600
here

366
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,279
same thing draw that line but a quarter

367
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,880
inch out make sure you don't have too

368
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,959
much paint in your brush for this

369
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,399
and you can push it down

370
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,640
and then you can just pull it forward

371
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,079
if you're collecting too much paint pull

372
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,200
it away and start over

373
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,880
there we go

374
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,160
that's a nice edge

375
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,519
this is one of the highest quality

376
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,279
paints on the market today this is the

377
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:00,720
new poly

378
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,079
poly way

379
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,279
this looks like a one coat coverage

380
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:04,560
paint but it's not

381
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,920
we've shown you how to cut the ceiling

382
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,519
how to do outside corners how to cut the

383
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,200
trim i'm going to just cut the rest of

384
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,560
this room real quick because you want to

385
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,399
do all of your brush work and then roll

386
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,000
your first coat the only other thing you

387
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,600
need to know about cutting in is this

388
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,320
when you've got wall plugs and switches

389
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,000
outlets

390
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,399
okay you want to brush the region

391
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,600
because you never want your roller to

392
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:24,880
get too close

393
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,160
sure sign of someone being in too much

394
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,240
of a hurry is when the electrical socket

395
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,000
has got paint all over it

396
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,240
okay and if you find yourself just a

397
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:33,360
little bit too much paint you can see

398
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,720
the brush marks

399
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,959
dust it out

400
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,480
get rid of those

401
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,480
there we go now it's time to roll so

402
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:42,079
we're all done the cut in now it's time

403
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,240
to do the rolling but before you do that

404
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,320
remember we're dealing with uh paint's

405
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,079
got a lot of technology and acrylic in

406
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,000
it time to wash this brush okay don't

407
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,600
wait to the end of the job or the brush

408
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,800
should be garbage that is a pro tip

409
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,880
all right well here's the rig

410
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,480
this has got the rest of our paint in it

411
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,680
okay

412
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,240
all right what i want to do is i want to

413
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,320
first i want to load the roller up this

414
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,600
takes a minute

415
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,680
okay it's just a matter of pushing that

416
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:09,440
paint in there

417
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,639
and get it nice and full

418
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,880
there we go

419
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,959
be patient

420
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,800
now if you have good quality paint it

421
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,839
won't drip

422
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,200
you get what you paint for right there

423
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,720
guys

424
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,320
now

425
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,320
for the rolling hallways are amazingly

426
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,760
difficult because

427
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,000
working with a stick oh look at that it

428
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,880
just passes it just clears

429
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,560
so if i don't extend it i can work all

430
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,079
the way top to bottom and that's how you

431
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:39,120
want to roll

432
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,279
none of this w business you want to just

433
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,199
get this up here

434
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,519
and just really lightly hardly touch the

435
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,560
wall

436
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,160
okay and the paint will come off all on

437
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,160
its own all right and then you want to

438
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,360
go about

439
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:55,440
two rollers wide

440
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,639
and then you want to go back where you

441
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,519
started

442
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:58,959
because there's a lot of extra paint on

443
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:00,240
that part of the wall

444
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,600
you want to get close to the edge but

445
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,440
not over the edge so about a half an

446
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,199
inch away

447
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,279
and that'll add texture to that earlier

448
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,320
brushwork

449
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,000
i always stop a few inches from the

450
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,760
bottom and a few inches from the top

451
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,600
that's why my cut line is about four

452
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,800
inches tall

453
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,480
so i never risk hitting the ceiling

454
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,600
all right

455
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,440
what we're doing here right now we're

456
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,639
trying to make the texture on the wall

457
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:23,760
consistent

458
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,440
every every paint company's got a

459
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,760
different coverage the materials are

460
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,360
made differently

461
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,519
okay and if you find that your wall just

462
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,760
looks too wet and too thick

463
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,839
keep stretching this out until it's not

464
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,680
the case anymore

465
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,360
i'm being blown away with the coverage

466
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,959
of this paint i love this new cabinet

467
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,199
trim and wall paint man

468
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,839
that's awesome okay and if you have

469
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,680
saggy texture

470
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:49,120
or it's a little different just back

471
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,720
roll

472
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,480
now that the roller is getting dry it'll

473
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,800
pick up the extra paint off the wall

474
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,839
and it'll make sure everything looks the

475
00:14:56,839 --> 00:14:59,920
same okay this is not about speed this

476
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:02,240
is about perfection

477
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,839
let's not be like these guys that are

478
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,120
out there with a double wide roller

479
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,480
trying to paint a whole wall in nine

480
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,519
seconds

481
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,920
that's a disaster it always is

482
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,680
because this paint has great coverage

483
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:13,040
we're going to leave a bit of a gap this

484
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,959
time so when we back roll we can roll

485
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,240
back onto it

486
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,680
now there's a lot in painting it's

487
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,519
called the wet edge

488
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,360
now i did not pick up as much paint as

489
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,199
the first time here

490
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,160
because

491
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:26,000
i'm just trying to make this easy the

492
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,440
wet edge

493
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,880
is right here

494
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,680
okay

495
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,040
and you always want to be painting where

496
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:34,160
the wet edge is before it starts to dry

497
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,320
remember we talked about paints nowadays

498
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,839
having a lot of technology in them

499
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,079
and it might say on the can it takes two

500
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,079
hours to dry

501
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,399
but that's just because there are still

502
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:48,480
houses out there that are left in

503
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,240
plaster

504
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:53,440
and if you see any lint get rid of it

505
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,160
and back roll it

506
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,360
there are still houses out there that

507
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,000
are laughing plaster and that technology

508
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,160
does take about two hours for an acrylic

509
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,160
paint to dry so the instructions on the

510
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,560
can are based on worst conditions truth

511
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:08,320
is this stuff can dry in 20 minutes on

512
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:11,120
the wall so you want to keep your lead

513
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,560
edge wet

514
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,560
which means if you start painting with

515
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,320
the roller and the phone rings you don't

516
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:18,399
stop painting you finish the wall and

517
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:20,399
you call them back or you will have a

518
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:22,480
definitive ridge

519
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,160
it'll dry in that few minutes that

520
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,079
you're gone

521
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:27,279
and then you're gonna have to pull out

522
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,519
the sanding block you're really just

523
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,920
melting this paint

524
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,399
into itself

525
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,959
to get a perfect look now if you've

526
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:38,639
never seen anybody paint with a stick

527
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,880
like this before how easy does that look

528
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,040
compared to hold on to it by hand

529
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,600
this stick only costs about 20

530
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:46,800
and you're gonna reach you don't need a

531
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,480
ladder

532
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,440
gravity does have to work

533
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,000
there we go

534
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,120
nice and controlled straight up and down

535
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,360
and then back roll to pick up the extra

536
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:02,560
paint

537
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,559
leave the texture consistent on the wall

538
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,799
and that is all you need to know

539
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,799
the truth is if you use good quality

540
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:10,959
tools and good quality paint painting is

541
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,640
easy

542
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,520
yep

543
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:16,799
it's actually a lot of fun

544
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,119
anyone who says they don't like to paint

545
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,999
is doing it wrong

546
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,480
this is incredibly satisfying

547
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,960
i have one more rule

548
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,840
because when you're rolling with a paint

549
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,840
you're actually rolling in a direction

550
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,720
and you create a grain with the texture

551
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:42,400
and you may not see it as long as you're

552
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,120
always rolling in the same direction

553
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,760
resist the temptation to ever change the

554
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:49,840
direction of the roll

555
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,200
okay

556
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,480
if you have a big window here and you

557
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,480
only have a one foot section of wall

558
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:56,400
don't go left to right

559
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,559
it'll show you'll actually see it in the

560
00:17:58,559 --> 00:17:59,760
texture in the wall that you change

561
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,880
directions

562
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:03,440
just use your roller down here like this

563
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,600
and do short little rolls

564
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,840
never change the direction of the roller

565
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,840
on a wall

566
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,520
ever

567
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,200
best thing about modern paint guys is

568
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,320
about an hour after you've done the

569
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,919
first coat you can jump into the second

570
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,000
coat if you've got conditioned air if

571
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,520
you've got air conditioning or a decent

572
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,280
heating system in your home not going to

573
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,200
be a problem just throw a fan on for a

574
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,720
few minutes and help speed up the drying

575
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,240
process and then you're going to want to

576
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,400
sand one more time do this

577
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,240
check your walls you'll feel it okay

578
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,039
one more time

579
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,400
because this paint is only an hour old

580
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,120
you will actually see

581
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,200
all the changes of where you actually

582
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,200
sanded something off as well if you look

583
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,760
down the light properly

584
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,919
okay look we we just tried to bring the

585
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,520
camera over so you can because i can see

586
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,799
this playing his day up against the

587
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,960
light the camera can't pick it up uh

588
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,039
truth is cameras lie

589
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,400
everything you're looking at on youtube

590
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,760
looks ten times better than it does in

591
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,360
reality the secret is when you're doing

592
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,640
your paint job

593
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,160
just trust me and do the sand in between

594
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,000
coats feel the wall before you sand and

595
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,440
after it'll blow your mind the

596
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,120
difference in the texture okay

597
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,799
this is the secret it's all right to

598
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,640
having a great finish i'm going to show

599
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,720
you how to do the second cut because the

600
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,840
second cut is where you get your

601
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,039
precision line

602
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:27,039
whenever you're painting a flat surface

603
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,799
you need to do the precision cut on the

604
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,720
second coat what it is is there's just

605
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,559
there's not as much resistance so you

606
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:33,760
don't need a lot of paint in your brush

607
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,919
and able to draw a perfect line without

608
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:38,000
having it snow plow up on you you know

609
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,600
what i mean right so here let's just

610
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,600
show you so here's the thing you push

611
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,000
the brush in you load it up

612
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,200
and then you clean it off

613
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,520
okay you don't want too much paint you

614
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,120
want it inside the brush not on top of

615
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,400
it

616
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,160
now

617
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,080
we're going to be running

618
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,080
a nice long straight line again right

619
00:19:58,080 --> 00:19:59,440
underneath the other one

620
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,039
but this time we're going to push the

621
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,039
brush right into the crack right into

622
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:06,120
the crease

623
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:10,720
you can come at it from either side

624
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,120
all right

625
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,280
and you're just going to use the tip of

626
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,200
that brush

627
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,400
okay and that's how you get a nice

628
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,720
straight line

629
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,840
if you use too much paint or you push

630
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,240
too hard or you try to be too quick

631
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,360
you're going to push it all over the

632
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,760
ceiling

633
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,840
but just a little bit of

634
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,720
pressure and because you're painting

635
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,320
from inside the brush you can actually

636
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,159
put the bristles right into the corner

637
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:39,679
and it'll come out perfect i got to get

638
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,679
that corner here we go kind of leaning

639
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:44,000
off the ladder here a little too much

640
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,120
now one of the rules when you're doing

641
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,880
your second coat

642
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,400
every wall surface that you paint you

643
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,080
paint all the cut on one wall and then

644
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,000
you roll that wall and then you move to

645
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,480
the next one because the first coat it's

646
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,159
okay if you can see the lines in the

647
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:57,919
roller it doesn't really matter the

648
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,840
first cut takes a long time

649
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,760
but once you get that first coat dry you

650
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,960
want to make sure you're finishing one

651
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,880
surface at a time

652
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,720
okay so you cut and roll each surface

653
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,400
individually

654
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,760
and that is how you're going to make

655
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,360
sure that you can blend

656
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,280
we talked about the wet edge this cut

657
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,120
can be wet the same time as i'm rolling

658
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,520
so now i'm blending the brush marks in

659
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,520
with the roller to put texture on it and

660
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,720
then you won't see brush marks

661
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,360
now if you're interested in learning

662
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,600
about how to do diy renovations

663
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,360
we have lots of videos on the channel to

664
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,600
help you with projects

665
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,280
the thing is

666
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,480
there's a lot of changes that have

667
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,240
happened in the industry

668
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,520
with building technology and

669
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:39,840
construction technology over the last

670
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,919
i'm going to say 80 years

671
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:44,159
ever since 1941 when they started the

672
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,679
national building code

673
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,120
a lot of different materials have come

674
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,559
out and different technologies so we

675
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:50,799
went from laughing plaster to drywall

676
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,880
with plaster from oil based to acrylic

677
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,240
paints uh

678
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,200
so

679
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,720
there's no such thing as a need for

680
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,280
primer if you're anything after 1975

681
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,720
unless they had oil paint on there for

682
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,080
some reason

683
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,760
you only need to use a transition primer

684
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,600
in certain circumstances the truth is

685
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,120
not everything is as simple as you like

686
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,960
it to be so considered joining a

687
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,720

688
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,600
month

ask us questions about your particular

692
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,280
job all you got to do is tell us the age

693
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,799
of your home and where you live and then

694
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,480
put in the question we'll be able to

695
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,000
help you up so when you're doing your

696
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,400
second roll you want to start where you

697
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:30,159
started your cut in so that you're

698
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:31,919
trying to get

699
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:34,080
the wet roller making contact with the

700
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,679
wet brushwork

701
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:37,360
okay

702
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,280
that's about it

703
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:40,960
resist the temptation to use too much

704
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:42,720
product you can tell when you're using

705
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,880
quality paint you get great hide already

706
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,640
so we're just looking for an extra 30

707
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,159
hide so you can stretch it out instead

708
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,679
of one roller you can go two or three

709
00:22:51,919 --> 00:22:53,679
the only other thing you want to do is

710
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,000
try not to roll dry

711
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,840
don't roll it so it gets so dry that

712
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,600
you're pushing too hard it just makes it

713
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,039
a lot of work

714
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,280
all right

715
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,520
you should be able to just

716
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,120
move the stick up and down without

717
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,720
putting a lot of pressure

718
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:12,080
and get the job accomplished

719
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,919
remember this is supposed to be fun not

720
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,799
a lot of work okay

721
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:18,400
all right

722
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,960
so you can see that after two coats with

723
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,039
the bright kind of finish and good

724
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,559
distribution of the paint you get a

725
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:26,559
really good look now

726
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,000
one more thing you need to know is that

727
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,760
most paints on the market that have a

728
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,440
high wash ability high durability

729
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,799
technology are also a 30-day curing

730
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:36,880
process okay

731
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,159
that means that after you've done the

732
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:39,840
painting it might be dry within a couple

733
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,520
hours it might feel nice and hard the

734
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,640
next day but resist the temptation to

735
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:47,440
hang pictures or mount fixtures or

736
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,200
anything like that on a freshly painted

737
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,039
surface for at least 48 hours give it

738
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,960
two days make sure it really starts to

739
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:53,919
get hard

740
00:23:53,919 --> 00:23:56,080
and after 30 days you can then be free

741
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:58,240
to do any kind of washing

742
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,400
if you get some dirty fingerprints or

743
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,640
some crayon on the paint don't wash it

744
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,640
